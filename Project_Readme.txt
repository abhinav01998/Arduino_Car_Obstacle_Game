Arduino-based Car Obstacle Game 
Course: ELG 5121
Group Number: 15
Members: Abhinav Thakur and Saima Tazreen

Platform: Arduino
Programming Language: C++
Library for LCD: <LiquidCrystal.h>
Software used: Arduino IDE and Tinkercad (for editing and debugging code on online platform)
Hardware used: Arduino UNO Microcontroller, 16x2 Backlight LCD Panel, Touch Sensor, Breadboard, 220 Ohm Resistor, 9V battery, Battery connector, Jumper wires, Connecting cable. We have future plans to add a vibration motor as an alert system, but this has not been implemented yet.

Project Summary:
We have chosen project number 2, design of a hardware-based haptic game. We have designed a car driving game using Arduino where the user input will be a touch sensor. Using this sensor, a user is able to begin playing the game, as well as direct the car left or right while playing. Trucks act as obstacles in the car's path, and if the car crashes into a truck, the game ends. Scoring is given based on how long the user can last without crashing. The game is displayed on the 16x2 LCD panel. We have incorporated the code of a vibration motor to alert the user when the game ends, however the hardware has not been tested yet due to unavailability. 

Contributions:
Abhinav Thakur: Code design and debugging
Saima Tazreen: Hardware design and implementation

Members worked remotely from different cities, hence the task was divided as such. However, the research and development needed for the project was equal from both members.
